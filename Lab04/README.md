# Comp 376 1 Algorithm Design Lab 4

1- Design and implement a divide and conquer algorithm for finding a position of the largest
number in an array of n numbers. For example, if the input array A[1..9] = [2,5,8,3,6,9,1,6,5],
your algorithm should return 6. [4 mark]

2- Consider the Mergesort algorithm, which is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. The
pseudocode for Mergesort is given in your textbook. Your task is to implement the algorithm,
and know exactly how it works. [6 mark]

1. Create a java file with a main() and a method mergSort().
2. In main() initialize an unsorted ArrayList A.
3. Call mergesort() with A() as input.
4. Margsort() should return a sorted array.
5. Main outputs the original and sorted arrays.
6. Submit your final program to D2l. Do your own work... do not submit someone elseâ€™s
    program!

## This question is optional (ie: not included in gade for the lab).

3- Given a sorted array of distinct integers A[0..n-1], design and implement a decrease and
conquer algorithm that find out whether there exists an index i for which A[i]=i.
